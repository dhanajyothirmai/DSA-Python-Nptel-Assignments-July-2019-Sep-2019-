Question 1 : 

What does h(3231) return for the following function definition?
 def h(x):
    (m,a) = (1,0)
    while m <= x:
        (m,a) = (m*2,a+1)
    return(a)
    
Solution : 12

Question 2 :

What is g(24) - g(23), given the definition of g below?

def g(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
    return(s)

Solution : 6

Question 3 :

Consider the following function f.

def f(n): 
    s=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if n%i == 0:
           s = s+1
    return(s%2 == 1)
The function f(n) given above returns True for a positive number n if and only if:

1. n is an odd number.
2. n is a prime number.
3. n is a composite number.
4. n is a perfect square.

Solution : Option 4.

Question 4 :
Consider the following function f.

def f(m):
    if m == 0:
      return(0)
    else:
      return(m+f(m-1))
Which of the following is correct?

1. The function always terminates with f(n) = factorial of n
2. The function always terminates with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
3. The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = factorial of n
4. The function terminates for non­negative n with f(n) = n(n+1)/2
 
Solution : Option 4.
